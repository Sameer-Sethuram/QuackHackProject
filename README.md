Our project makes splitting the bill at restuaruants incredibly easy by allowing you to take a picture of the check and then 
through the use of Tesseract and OpenCV identify bill items and allow for the user to digitally assign them to each party. The
app will then appropriatley update the balance of each user and allow for the user to pay through Stripe.

Tech Stack: Java, SQL, XML, Android Studio, Tesseract, OpenCV, Stripe, and Room.
